# ConsolePixelatorCSharp
A quick and easy pixelator program that generate a new pixelated image from a starting image. Works only on Windows

The pixelation amount is the side of the square that will result in "1 pixel" (averaging the colors of the pixels inside). A pixelation amount 4 means that 16 pixels will be one pixel in the pixelated image.
The new image is actually roughly the same height and width of the old image, but (if we took the earlier example), 16 pixels will be of the same color, giving the pixelation effect.
